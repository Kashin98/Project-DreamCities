# Project-DreamCities

Creating a fictional Travel website from scratch to learn the full scale of CSS Flexbox and use it.

Using similar AWS services to previous project to better understand them

Hosted on AWS S3 bucket.

Website is using the AWS Cloudfront service for a CDN. Redirecting all HTTP requests to HTTPS for secure conn.

This is the bucket's direct Endpoint "http://project-dreamcities-flexbox.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com" which is blocked. CDN is linked below.

WEBSITE FULLY ACCESSIBLE THROUGH CDN: "https://d26158ih9pfx39.cloudfront.net"

Learned how to:

1.) Work with CSS flexbox on fullscale website

2.) More Javascript for internal page links and navbar functionality with internal links  

Website optimized for all screen sizes.

(All used AWS services expire around end of 2021 for this project)
